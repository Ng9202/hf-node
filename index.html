        <h1>Introduction to Birds</h1>

        <h2>What are Birds?</h2>
        <p>
            Birds are warm-blooded vertebrates characterized by feathers, wings, and beaks. They are the only animals with feathers, which serve multiple purposes including flight, insulation, and display. With over 10,000 species worldwide, birds are incredibly diverse and can be found in almost every habitat on Earth.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Features of Birds</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Feathers:</strong> Unique to birds, feathers provide insulation, enable flight, and are used for display and camouflage.</li>
            <li><strong>Hollow Bones:</strong> Many bird bones are hollow, reducing weight for flight.</li>
            <li><strong>Beaks:</strong> Birds have beaks instead of teeth, adapted for their specific diets.</li>
            <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> All birds lay eggs, which they incubate until hatching.</li>
            <li><strong>High Metabolism:</strong> Birds have fast metabolisms to support the energy demands of flight.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Types of Birds</h2>
        <p>
            Birds are classified into various groups based on their characteristics and behaviors. Some major groups include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Passerines (Perching Birds):</strong> The largest order, including sparrows, robins, and crows.</li>
            <li><strong>Raptors:</strong> Birds of prey like eagles, hawks, and owls.</li>
            <li><strong>Waterfowl:</strong> Ducks, geese, and swans adapted for aquatic life.</li>
            <li><strong>Shorebirds:</strong> Plovers, sandpipers, and gulls found near water.</li>
            <li><strong>Flightless Birds:</strong> Penguins, ostriches, and emus that have evolved to live without flight.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h2>Amazing Bird Facts</h2>
            <p>
                The Arctic Tern holds the record for the longest migration, traveling over 44,000 miles annually between the Arctic and Antarctic. The smallest bird is the Bee Hummingbird, measuring just 2 inches in length, while the largest is the Ostrich, which can stand up to 9 feet tall!

        <h2>Importance of Birds</h2>
        <p>
            Birds play crucial roles in ecosystems worldwide. They are pollinators, seed dispersers, pest controllers, and indicators of environmental health. Their songs and behaviors enrich human culture, and birdwatching is a popular hobby enjoyed by millions globally.
